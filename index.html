                    The 11-20% grade has zero buffer from the street. the architecture 
                    of the houses in this neighborhood are built from 2-3 set templates
                    There is adequate streetlighting, also a fairly quiet street. Absolutely 
                    no tree coverage on the sidewalks or street however.

                    The 1-10% has the most tree coverage on the sidewalks and streets
                    from this neighborhood. this is also an extremely quiet street, 
                    especially since there are no houses on the otherside. This area
                    is interesting since a sycamore tree trail separates these
                    single-family homes from the apartments right across, which are 
                    a 31-40% environmentally-impacted area. 
                    
                There is significant overlap of the higher rated CalEnviroScreen
                        with higher % of Low-income populations
                </p>
                <p> CalEnviroScreen is a screening tool used to help identify 
                        communities disproportionately burdened by multiple sources
                        of pollution and with population characteristics that make 
                        them more sensitive to pollution.
                        There is a slight correlation of limited-English speakers with
                            higher % of Low-income populations.

                In one instance, a fellow member of a community discussion group
                on Facebook wrote that my hometown didn't need to hold a protest 
                against police brutality because she didn't believe it happened 
                there, which I noted was a reflection of her own privilege as 
                a White woman in suburbia. In another conversation, a woman 
                said that people should just vote instead of yelling in the 
                streets. In response, I offered some insight about voter 
                suppression and its impact on Black people and immigrants, 
                particularly in lower-income communities. Over the course of 
                about a week, I made it my mission to dispel beliefs I felt 
                were founded on ignorance. Despite these efforts, I really 
                don't think I managed to break through the suburban bubble of 
                oblivion.
